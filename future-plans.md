# Future Development Plans for This Portfolio

## Bugs to Squash

* JPG on one portfolio card isn't working

## Immediate Needs

* Add more apps to portfolio

* Re-write ReadMe to reflect an actual portfolio.

* Add a link to the deployed site everywhere applicable: Resume, GitHub profile, GitHub repo, LinkedIn etc.

## 2nd Phase Refactor

* Project component for listing portfolio projects

* Investigate warning about opening in blank tab

* Investigate warning about body inside a div

* Look through files & see what I can do otherwise do better

## Later Possibilities

* Jazz it up. What else do I want to add? Consider a color palette.

* Rethink the entire structure. Is this how I want to display my work? Consider starting a new app & repo if necessary.

* Consider a section / tab on what I'm learning now. 

* Consider a Work In Progress section that hightlights detailed plans on those projects.
